JXCore for OpenWRT
====================

I appreciate all the work that jxcore has done to getting Node.js working on OpenWRT with a small binary footprint.

However it's a hassle to use their build system because it forces me to download the SDK each time which is just silly.

So I created a package which links to my own version of the jxcore code with a build fix (hopefully I can change this later when they merge my pull request).
